* To do list
** Coding [2/6]
   - [X] add the notion of a renderer (render image by name at a given point, flush the display, etc...)
   - [X] in_game_view to render a puzzle delegating stuff to a renderer
   - [ ] sdl_renderer that actually uses, ahem, SDL
   - [ ] in_game_mode that uses an in_game_view and an sdl_controller to load and display one single puzzle (uses a factory to create stuff...)
   - [ ] First version of the game that loads a known puzzle
   - [ ] version with command line arguments to load a puzzle by name
