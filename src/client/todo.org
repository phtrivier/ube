* client
 - prepare a test suite, gmock/gtest-enabled
* file_checker
 - write a "concrete" file checker (make it testable by checking for local files that you just created ... or for itself)
 - write a mock file checker
* resource manager
 - write a test, using a mock file checker
 - note that the file_checker should only be called once; we don't want to test for folder presence 
   everytime, after a while we can simply expect things to exists ...
