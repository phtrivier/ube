h1. Folder organisation 

'TBD' means the folder does not exists yet, and has to be created / integrated in the build system.

 - src : C++ implementation files for the code
   - engine : source code for the engine of the game (compiled as libube-engine)
     - test : source code for the Google Test unit test ; compiled into and executable ube-engine-test
   - editor : source code for the associated game editor
     - test : source code for the Google Test unit tests
   - client : source code for the game client (some parts might be compiled as libube-client)

 - lib : third party libraries (TBD). This folder should be persistent. It might contain 'hard-imported' libs (gtest ? sdl?)
   - linux : third-party libs for linux (both for engine and editor)
   - win32 : third-party libs for windows

 - build : results of builds (TBD). This folder shoudl be cleanable by 'scons -c'.
   - linux : binairies and libraries for build under linux
   - win32 : binairies and libraries for build under win32

TODO : Where do I put i18n files ? 

 - doc : documentation (will be written in some markup language or another) (TBD)
   - src : source files for the manual
   - dist : output for the builds of the manual
     - pdf : manual in pdf format
     - html : manual in html format

 - org : kitchen-sink for plan, diary, ideas, maybe even bugs if I read some
