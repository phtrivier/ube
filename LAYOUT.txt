h1. Folder organisation 

'TBD' means the folder does not exists yet, and has to be created / integrated in the build system.

 - src : C++ implementation files for the code
   - engine : source code for the engine of the game (compiled as libube-engine)
     - tests : source code for the Google Test unit test ; compiled into and executable ube-engine-test
     - lua : lua files that are part of the engine
   - editor : source code for the associated game editor
     - tests : source code for the Google Test unit tests
   - client : source code for the game client (some parts might be compiled as libube-client)
     - tests : source code for the game client's specific parts.

 - data : run-time data
   - images : images in PNG format
   - fonts : TTF fonts
   - lua (TBD) : run-time lua scripts that are not part of the engine
     - adventures : set of levels that ship with the game
       - main : main set of level that ship with the game
   (Note : the layout is only here to make it possible to ship several set of levels with the game, should
   I want to go that road again)

 - lib : third party libraries. This folder should be persistent. It might contain 'hard-imported' libs (gtest ? sdl?)

 - include : includes for third party libs.

 - po : po files for gettext

 - scripts : usefull scripts. In particular, scripts/cc_linux.sh and scripts/cc_w32.sh are used to help in compilation.
   Those scripts should be launched from the top level folder.

 - builds : results of builds (This folder is generated).
   - linux/tmp_XXXXXX : temporary folder for the build. configure is run from this folder. It is deleted at the end of a build.
   - linux/ube_XXXXXX : result of a build AND a local installation
   - linux/latest : symbolic link to the latest successfull build and installation

   - w32/* : same structure for windows builds

 - doc : documentation (will be written in some markup language or another) (TBD)
   - src : source files for the manual
   - dist : output for the builds of the manual
     - pdf : manual in pdf format
     - html : manual in html format

 - org : kitchen-sink for plan, diary, ideas, maybe even bugs if I read some
