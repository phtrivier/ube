UBE uses autoconf / automake as its build system. 

So all the standard configure options should work. Here are some
deails on how to build it.

I assume you're building from a tarball distribute (ube-x.y.z.tar.gz)

* Required libs

You should have a number of libs installed. At least the following :

 - gettext (0.17 works for me)
 - SDL (1.2.13 works for me)
 - SDL_image (1.2.7 works for me)
 - SDL_mixer (1.2.8 works for me)
 - SDL_ttf (2.0.9 works for me)
 - popt (1.14.4 works for me)
 - boost (1.34.1 works for me)
 - lua (5.1.4 works for me)

If you need anything else, please tell me !

* Ubuntu 9.10

Lua is distributed in a 'strange' (or at least non standard ?) way in
Ubuntu. So the lua libs cannot easily be found by configure, and you
have to baby-sit it somehow. Anyway, if you want to build, you will
need at last :

 configure --with-lua-prefix=/usr/include/lua5.1 --with-lua-suffix=5.1
 make
 make install

Note that you can always use --prefix=/where/ever/you/want to install
in another place than the standard distribution

* Other GNU/Linux distro 

Honestly, I don't know !! I haven't tested it anywhere else, if you do
and you have troubles / it works, please drop a note !

If you run into lua issues, the trick might be to set :

  --with-lua-prefix to the folder that contains lua.h
  --with-lua-suffix to the suffix of the liblua*.a file in your /usr/lib

* Windows

There should be a Setup.exe installer for windows, so why would you
want to build it from sources. Are you a masochich or somethings ;) ?

More seriously, the build system can be used to cross compile the
application on linux for windows (this is what I do), but you'll need
the full sources, a very nice project called mingw-cross-env, and you
don't want to do it now, really.

Also, it *might* be possible to build it with another compiler, cygwin
or whatever. I just don't know.

* Mac OS

I have no clue how building works on those Apple thingy, but I promise
I'll try someday :)

* Tweak and shout

If you have any question / proposal / patch / wedding proposal, please
drop a note at phtrivier@yahoo.fr.

Good luck, good night and Have fun !
