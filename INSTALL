UBE uses autoconf / automake as its build system. 

So all the standard configure options should work. Here are some
deails on how to build it.

I assume you're building from a tarball distribute (ube-x.y.z.tar.gz)

* Required libs

You should have a number of libs installed. At least the following :

 - gettext (0.17 works for me)
 - SDL (1.2.13 works for me)
 - SDL_image (1.2.7 works for me)
 - SDL_mixer (1.2.8 works for me)
 - SDL_ttf (2.0.9 works for me)
 - popt (1.14.4 works for me)
 - boost (1.34.1 works for me)

If you need anything else, please tell me !

* Ubuntu 9.10

Install the dependencies ; something like this should do : 

 sudo apt-get install libsdl-ttf2.0-0 libsdl-ttf2.0-dev gettext libboost1.38-dev libpopt0 libpopt-dev pkg-config libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

Then you can build things the "usual" way : 

 ./configure
 make
 make install

Note that you can always use --prefix=/where/ever/you/want to install
in another place than the standard distribution

* Other GNU/Linux distro 

Honestly, I don't know !! I haven't tested it anywhere else, if you do
and you have troubles / it works, please drop a note !

* Microsoft Windows (tm)

There should be a Setup.exe installer for windows, so why would you
want to build it from sources. Are you a masochich or somethings ;) ?

More seriously, the build system can be used to cross compile the
application on linux for windows (this is what I do), but you'll need
the full sources, a very nice project called mingw-cross-env, and you
don't want to do it now, really.

Also, it *might* be possible to build it with another compiler, cygwin
or whatever. I just don't know.

* Mac OS (tm ?)

I have no clue how building works on those Apple thingy, but I promise
I'll try someday :)

* Tweak and shout

If you have any question / proposal / patch / wedding proposal, please
drop a note at phtrivier@yahoo.fr.

Good luck, good night and Have fun !
