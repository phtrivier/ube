To configure on a debian system, with lua5.1 installed

../configure --with-lua-prefix=/usr/include/lua5.1 --with-lua-suffix=5.1

-- 

To cross compile, assuming you have installed mingw-cross-env-2.8, and package sdl lua gettext  

export M32=/home/phtrivier/sandbox/src/mingw-cross-env-2.8/usr/i386-mingw32msvc
export PATH=$M32/bin:$PATH
mkdir build-win32
cd build-win32
../configure --host=i386-mingw32msvc --build=i586-pc-linux --with-lua-prefix=$M32/include

This should build a nice cross compiled version.

Next things to figure out : how do you set DATADIR to something that makes sense on a windows machine ?
